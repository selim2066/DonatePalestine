            <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-4xl">How do you get funds and supplies into Gaza when there's
                a blockade?</div>
            <div class="collapse-content text-2xl">Most items that come into Gaza first come through commercial
                entities, not through NGOs. These commercial suppliers are approved and are usually allowed in,
                especially for food items and medical supplies. Whenever borders are closed, Islamic Relief has
                prequalified suppliers and that enables us to procure items quickly from within Gaza to meet immediate
                needs. Some of our partners are able to bring in-kind donations from outside Gaza and the West Bank.
                Items can sometimes get blocked during escalations, when borders are closed, or if there are delays at
                the Karem Abu Salem crossing (the main crossing for goods into Gaza). However, they do usually get
                through. We work hard to ensure that these essential supplies as well as what is available in local
                markets, are available for the immediate need..</div>

            <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-4xl">Why is it a better option to give gunds to humanitarian
                organizations instead?</div>
            <div class="collapse-content text-2xl">Humanitarian organizations are able to assess needs on the ground on
                a wider scale, and in coordination with relevant actors (i.e. ministries and UN Clusters) to determine
                the best way to utilize funds as per the urgent needs on the ground. Humanitarian organizations also
                have standards they must maintain to ensure high-quality assistance is provided such as operating
                standards and quality of aid, while also ensuring there is no duplication so that every person can be
                reached equitably./div>

            <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-4xl">Isn't it better to just send money directly through
                people who have family in Palestine?</div>
            <div class="collapse-content text-2xl">During times of crisis and emergency, banks and monetary
                institutions are often impacted. This can prevent families from accessing banks and withdrawing
                funds. Humanitarian organizations have existing relationships with banks and available funds on
                reserve that they can access and utilize during such emergency crises to ensure a quick response.

            <div class="collapse-content text-2xl">Transparency is our key value. That is why we post pictures,
                share videos, and, most importantly, we account for every dollar given through reports on our
                website and audits every single year.
